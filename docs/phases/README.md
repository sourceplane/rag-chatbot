# The phases — one blueprint, two selections, one landing that deploys

`repo-blueprint.yaml` declares two phases that take a RAG chatbot from
**nothing** to **live on stage and prod, documented**. Run them one at a time
with `--phase <name>`, or both unattended with `--resume`. There is no
umbrella workflow and no per-phase document: a phase is a selection on one
artifact, which is what makes running one alone, months later, from a fresh
container the same operation as running them all.

Each phase follows the same contract:

> **place its modules → brand them → land them as one pull request → watch
> the convergence that merge triggers (auto-resumed) → verify the outcome.**

Run from the baseline checkout (the blueprint's source is `path: .`); the
product's repository is wherever `--out` points.

## Execution order

| phase | lands | verified by |
|---|---|---|
| [`01-product`](01-product.md) | **the GitHub repo created**, then the WHOLE product in one PR: intent, CI, tooling, the Supabase and Hyperdrive Terraform roots, the migrations, the app and its tests — one convergence provisions and deploys it in dependency order | convergence green; `SUPABASE_*` and `WIRING_CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE` published on stage and prod; `/` and `/api/health` answer on both |
| [`02-docs`](02-docs.md) | the live-deployment record; the promotion gate and dev's lanes put back | committed manifest matches probed reality |

**One landing builds the product.** The order the data plane needs — the
Supabase project before the Hyperdrive config over its database, both before
the migrations, all three before the app — is not a sequence of landings. It
is the components' own `dependsOn`, every edge `mode: enforced` on a push to
`main` and advisory on a pull request:

```
supabase ──▶ cloudflare-hyperdrive ──▶ db-migrate ──▶ web        (per environment)
```

A job resolves its secrets when it starts, so each one reads what the apply
before it published: Hyperdrive the project's ref and password, db-migrate
the project's credentials, the app's deploy the Hyperdrive id it binds.
`testing/placement.test.sh` reads that order off the product's own
`orun plan --trigger github-push-main`.

Every landing is a pull request on a branch named for its task
(`orun/BASE-<n>-<phase>`). On those branches `ci.yml` runs `plan` only — the
intent, every component and every composition resolve — and skips the lanes,
because the merge runs them on main a minute later, for real, and that
convergence is what the phase watches. `checks.yml` (install, typecheck,
lint, test, build) runs on every pull request regardless.

There is no custom-domain phase: the app answers on workers.dev. Attaching a
domain needs zone permissions the brokered `workers-deploy` token does not
carry, so it is an owner's step after the bootstrap (the product's README,
"Custom domain").

## Inputs

`01-product` takes the product's identity once and writes it into the repo
(`.rebrand/values.json`); `02-docs` reads it back from the placed tree. But
the blueprint's **required** inputs — `reponame`, `productname`,
`productdomain`, `githuborg` — are validated before any phase runs, so they
must be supplied on every invocation, single-phase ones included. A
`--values` file is easier than repeating `--set`.

- `subdomain` — the workers.dev subdomain of the Cloudflare account. It is
  in every URL the phases probe.
- `orunWorkspace` — workspace id (`ws_…`). Unset, it is the workspace the
  build runs in (`from: workspace`); with none anywhere, a placeholder that
  fails loudly rather than silently claiming another tenant's workspace.
- `epicSlug` (default `rag-baselining`) — the epic every phase clubs its
  task under. Found by slug, so a fresh run and a resumed run find the same
  work.
- `repoPrivate` (default `true`) — the repository's visibility at creation.

```bash
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml \
  --out $HOME/products/acme-rag --run-hooks --phase 01-product \
  --values ~/acme-rag.values.yaml
```

Drop `--run-hooks` (or add `--status`) to preview. Without it a phase places
files and stops: no repo, no landing, no convergence watch, and no probe —
which is exactly what makes a dry instantiation of this baseline possible in
CI with no workspace and no provider (`testing/placement.test.sh`,
`testing/e2e.test.sh`).

## No AI vendor is a phase

The platform brokers no AI vendor, so nothing here mints, asks for or waits
on a model key. The models are Workers AI's — `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
for the chat, `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` for the embeddings — reached
through the Worker's `AI` binding in the Cloudflare account the deploy
targets, so the product chats, adds to its knowledge base and answers from
it on its first deploy. An owner who wants upstream's gateway model for the
chat adds `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` as a Worker secret afterwards (the product's
README, "Use a vendor model instead"), and re-running `02-docs` records it.

## When a phase fails

- **Before it lands** (a probe that timed out, a rebrand residue, a refused
  link): nothing was merged. Fix what the message names and re-run the phase.
- **After it lands** (the convergence went red): the files are on main.
  `orun.run/watch@v1` has already resumed the run up to three times. Re-run
  the phase (`--phase 01-product`, `--redo 01-product` under `--resume`, or
  the console's Retry): its `retouch` hook gives the landing a diff and the
  components it names re-plan. Supabase and Hyperdrive are adopted rather
  than recreated (`adopt.tf`), and the migration ledger lives in the
  database, so a re-run applies only what is missing.
