-- Row-level security on every table in `public`, and no policies.
--
-- Supabase's Data API (PostgREST) serves `public` to anyone holding the
-- project's anon key, which is public by Supabase's design. Upstream assumed
-- a private Postgres, so its tables — every resource a user added and every
-- embedding cut from it — had no RLS, and the Data API would hand them out.
-- With RLS enabled and no policy, `anon` and `authenticated` read and write
-- NOTHING through it. The app is not affected: it connects through
-- Hyperdrive as `postgres` (the cloudflare-hyperdrive root's database_user),
-- which created and owns these tables, and a table's owner is not subject to
-- its RLS unless FORCE is set (it is not). The migration ledgers
-- (`_migrations`, drizzle-kit's `drizzle`) are schemas the Data API does not
-- expose. The app uses neither the Data API nor Supabase Auth, so no policy
-- is needed for it to work.
--
-- apps/web/lib/db/schema/*.ts declare `.enableRLS()` on each table, which is
-- how drizzle-kit wrote the ALTERs below (its twin is
-- apps/web/lib/db/migrations/0002_row_level_security.sql); tests/db fails if
-- any table in `public` is left without RLS after the migrations.
--
-- FIRST, the guard. If `postgres` neither owns every table here nor has
-- SUPERUSER or BYPASSRLS, enabling RLS would lock the app out of its own
-- data: stop. The guard changes nothing and runs before the first ALTER, so
-- a refusal enables nothing. Idempotent: ENABLE on an enabled table is a
-- no-op.
